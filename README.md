# Language Practice Chatbot

### Author: Joseph Cheatham

## Description
This is my web based chatbot that allows users to engage in conversational practice using the ChatGPT API (Work in progress)


## Current Progress
The chatbot can currently read and respond to messages, but does not remember conversation context.
The next step will be adding the ability to pass message history to the OpenAI servers to utilize conversation context.
